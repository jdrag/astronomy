SatellitesEphemeris produces a lib which deals with some satellites of Jupiter and Saturn (as well as the Saturn's ring position angle).
I took the calculations from the lib from my planetarium software Power Age Sky Simulator (www.powerageskysimulator.com) I made more than 20 years ago.
Calculation methods I use are mostly from the incredible "Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus, Second Edition.
